üß© Illustrious-XL Prompt Structure
Base Template:
[Subject Description] + [Scene Description] + [Define Style] + [Lens Language] + [Atmosphere Words] + [Detail Modifiers]

1. Subject (Main Focus)
Describe the main subject clearly ‚Äî include physical and stylistic traits that can change (clothes, pose, expression, accessories).
Exclude immutable traits like race or gender unless essential. Brand or concept references add realism and luxury tone.
Example: 1girl, korean idol, long wavy pink hair, glossy lips, confident expression, elegant mini dress by Dior, sparkling jewelry

2. Scene (Environment Context)
Describe the spatial and environmental characteristics. The scene should feel immersive and atmospheric, not just a background.
Example: neon-lit city street at night, wet pavement, glass reflections, shallow depth of field

3. Define Style (Artistic Style)
Specify the visual tone or artistic medium. Illustrious-XL performs best with realistic and cinematic descriptors.
Example: (masterpiece, best quality, ultra high res, photorealistic, cinematic film still, DSLR RAW photo, IMAX tone, analog film look)

4. Lens Language (Camera Grammar)
Define composition, focal length, shot type, and perspective. Use real-world photographic terminology.
Example: Full body shot, low-angle, 50mm f/1.4 lens, shallow depth of field, cinematic composition, rule of thirds

5. Atmosphere Words (Lighting and Mood)
Define lighting, time of day, weather, or environmental air density. Focus on the light temperature and diffusion quality.
Example: golden hour sunlight, warm soft backlight, misty air, cinematic fog, volumetric light, subtle bloom

6. Detail Modifiers (Fine Technical Details)
Enhance realism, clarity, texture, and exposure. Use photo-technical language.
Example: 8k uhd, hdr, film grain, natural color grading, ultra realistic skin texture, perfect exposure, soft tone mapping, vivid contrast, bokeh highlights
